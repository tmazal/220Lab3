    // In other words, when you first start, the number of potential moves that a player could make would be
    // the board's size x size because the absolute largest number of moves is the number of cells on the board.

    // simplicity's sake, in the Game's findMoves() method, this will still be initialized to the board's 
    // size x size length.  That means that the numMoves field (below) will hold the actual number of potential
    // moves in the potentialMoves array (and there will be spaces at teh end of the array that are unused).
